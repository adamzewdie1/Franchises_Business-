Franchise Abandonment Risk Dashboard
Overview

This project analyzes franchise store performance across multiple brands (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical) to:

Predict the risk of franchise abandonment (when a store owner stops operating and paying royalties).

Segment stores into three categories: high-performing, consistent, and low-performing.

Forecast biweekly revenue for each store.

It combines financial data, clustering, and machine learning to:

Detect struggling stores.

Forecast future revenue and royalty streams.

Provide dashboards for decision-making and risk monitoring.

Features

- Data Ingestion & Cleaning — handles royalty, revenue, and payment history.

- Performance Segmentation — clusters stores by revenue history using KMeans and DBSCAN.

- Predictive Modeling — logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting (XGBoost) models classify abandonment risk.

- Explainability — SHAP values and feature-importance plots interpret the key drivers of risk.

- Interactive Dashboard — store-level visuals (scatter, pie, heatmap) with filtering by brand, state, or owner.

- Business Logic Integration — incorporates rules such as $750 minimum royalty, government loan usage, and store age (years open).
